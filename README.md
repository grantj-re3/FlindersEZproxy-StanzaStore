# FlindersEZproxy-StanzaStore

Scripts which support storing EZproxy stanzas in a folder (one text-file
per stanza) and allows subsets of them to be selected and extracted into
one or more aggregated stanza files. The aggregated stanza files can be
included (using "IncludeFile") into config.txt eg. to define stanzas for
an EZproxy group.
